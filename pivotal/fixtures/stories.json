    "description": "should work the same as database adds. Jobs should not show up on everyone's screen until approved. Once approved all recruiters and principles should be able to see. The sales rep and sales reps managers should be able to see as well. \n\nTask description:\n\nRoute job for a approval\nhttps://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/49068065\n\nAfter adding a new job, you should have the ability to route it for approval. So we'll probably need the flag and the actions for approving a job.\n\nPlease not that the job can have the following status:\n\nNew -> Approved -> On Hold -> Closed\n\nIn this user story, we're just going to handle the New to Approved transition. So when you add a new job, its status should default to New.\n\nOnly the salesman that created the job and its managers can see the job with status of New.\n\nNow, when you are a salesman or a sales manager, you can view the flag and, if the job is New, you can select Submit for Approval. Then the approval goes to the manager screen. Once it's approved, the job status should become Approved and then it's visible by anyone.\n\nSo in this task you should:\n\n1. add the job status\n2. only show approved jobs for everybody\n3. only show jobs in status New if the owner is the salesman or its manager\n4. add the flag to the job view with the \"Route for Approval\" link\n5. add jobs to manager approvals screen",
